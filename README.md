# docs-auto-scale-user-guide
User Guide for Auto Scale + its family of prereqs (Monitoring + Load Balancers + Servers)

This is work in progress toward publication at https://developer.rackspace.com/docs/user-guides/.

- diy-curl.docx is the original
- diy-curl.rst was generated from diy-curl.doc with this pandoc command: pandoc diy-curl.docx -f docx -t rst -s -o diy-curl.rst

Basic instructions on how to generate a user-guide coded in RST and assembled by Sphinx are at https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-core-infra-user-guide/blob/master/README.md.
